# Random Quote Generator
Task potential realization instance according to Unit 1 Treehouse Full-Stack 
JS Developer Program. 

The example operates quotes of famous Belorussian people, i.e.:
* [Рыгор Барадулін](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryhor_Baradulin)
* [Францішак Скарына](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francysk_Skaryna)
* [Якуб Колас](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakub_Kolas)
* [Макалай Крыштаф Радзівіл Сіротка](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_Krzysztof_%22the_Orphan%22_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82).

To start the project please select source code directory via operating system terminal 
and run two commands  consistently:
```shell
    npm install
    npm start
```

This will run simple http server at http://localhost:9000/ address.  
*You can surely simply run index.html file in your browser over protocol file://.
Choosing this you will waste an opportunity to enjoy a unique font, as far as it wouldn't be downloaded after all.
The quote font used in the current project is a digitized handwriting of a famous Belorussian poet
